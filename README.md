Troubleshoot common issues during the import process, such as data mismatches, encoding problems, or large file handling.
Steps for Importing Excel Data into MySQL
The process of importing data from Excel into MySQL Workbench typically involves the following steps:

Prepare Your Excel Spreadsheet: Clean up the data by removing unnecessary columns, correcting data types, and ensuring all fields are consistent (e.g., date formats, numeric values).
Export Data to CSV: While MySQL Workbench does not directly import Excel files, you can save your Excel data as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file.
